    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to simulate photons moving in the $z$-direction through an atmosphere from $z=0$ to $z=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This atmosphere shoould be divided into $N_{l} \\ge 100$ layers. In each layer $\\Delta z = \\frac{1}{N_{l}}$ let the probability of absorption be $P[\\Delta z] = \\frac{1}{N_{l}}$. Use the `np.random.uniform()` function.  \n",
    "- The direction of emission is random, where the probability of the emitted photon moving in the positize ($+z$) direction is the same as moving in the negative ($-z$) direction. \n",
    "- Eventually the photon either gets back to $z=0$ or moves above $z=1$, and the simulation for that photon stops. \n",
    "- Do this for about 10,000 photons and track how many made it $z=1$ and how many went back to $z=0$.\n",
