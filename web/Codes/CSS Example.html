<h1>A letter to HTML in HTML</h1>

<p>Dear HTML,</p>
<p>Your threadbare design you make from my HTML code is admirable, its simplicity is unparalleled.</p>
<p>But, sometimes I can't help but want <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink'>hyperlinks</a> in colors other than blue!</p>
<p>And, sometimes I want all my text to be a striking purple.</p>
<p>AND, I want to change my background to be a dark purple!</p>
