Many source files reference other data in the folders. Images, scripts, and some sounds are stored alongside the example solutions.

For the example projects to run in-browser the files they reference need to be accessible. Extract the whole compressed folder before starting to ensure that those files can be reached by the code.

Once you've decompressed the zip that contained this txt file feel free to discard this message.

Happy developing!
